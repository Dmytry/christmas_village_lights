# Addressable LED controller for christmas village

Controls an individually addressable LED string to make it look like houses are turning lights on and off and have fireplaces on.

I used it with an Arduino Nano and a cheap 50-LED WS2811 RGB string bought on Amazon. 

I extended the string inbetween groups of 2..4 lights with an extra ribbon cable (to be able to reach from a 
house to another house), using solder sleeve connectors.
